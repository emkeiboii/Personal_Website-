      <p>
        BORN AND RAISED IN ITALY, BOLOGNA.

MARK ATTENDED GRAPHIC SCHOOL, BUT LOOKING FOR A NEW CHALLENGE HE STARTED LEARNING WEB DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT HE BELIEVES IN CONQUERING EVERYTHING HIS MIND HAS SET ITSELF TO. <br>
<br>
THROUGH GRAPHIC SCHOOL HE LEARNT ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR, ADOBE PHOTOSHOP AND ADOBE INDESIGN. <br>
<br>
THROUGH ONLINE COURSES HE LEARNT HTML AND CSS, WHILE STILL FIGURING OUT JAVASCRIPT.<br>
<br>
WHEN NOT BASHING HIS KEYBOARD, HE MAY BE AT THE GYM, IN THE KITCHEN OR AT THE PARK.<br>
<br>
WHATEVER YOU SEE, IS THE REFLECTION OF HIS TIME AND EFFORT, LEARNING, SUCCEEDING AND FAILING.
