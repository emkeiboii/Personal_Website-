        <h2>who i am</h2>
        <p>I'm Mark, graphic designer and wannabe front-end (one day fullstack) web developer. I attended highschool at IPSAS Aldrovandi Rubbiani, because i was so in love with graphic design, and interested in the creative process of everything i saw.<br>
          <strong>WEB DEVELOPMENT?</strong><br>
          After my diploma i wanted a new challenge, a new skill that would work together with my graphic design knowledge. I was inspired as i saw incredible websites like Apple's, so i got myself to work; learning HTML, CSS and JS(still working on that :P).<br>  
          <strong>WHAT KEEPS ME GOING</strong><br>
          My dream is to be successful, inspire and to always be the best version of myself.</p>

        <h2>what i do</h2>
        <p>Although i want to mainly focus on web development through the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and their frameworks/libraries. I am very competent in the use of the Adobe suite, more specifically:
          <ul>
          <li>Illustrator;</li>
          <li>Photoshop;</li>
          <li>Basics of InDesign;</li>
          <li>Basics of AfterEffects.</li>
          </ul>
          I understand very well the importance of color, typography and imagery in order to create an effective product.

        <h2>passion</h2>
        <p>
          I'm absolutely fixated with the idea of success and greatness, i think everyone wants to be someone and to leave some sort of impression, but when iâ€™m not thinking about studying or busy working on a project i love:
          <ul>
            <li>Going to the gym;</li>
            <li>Cooking;</li>
            <li>Playing video games.</li>
          </ul>
          I understand the importance of balance in life, and that's why i work hard now, so that in the future i can relax, be free and enjoy what life really is: Friends, Family and Health.
